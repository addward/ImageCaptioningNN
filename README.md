# ImageCaptioningNN
This repo is created as final project in [Deep Learning School](https://en.dlschool.org/).<br>
It consists of two models, [baseline](#architecture-of-the-base-model) and [advanced model](#architecture-of-the-advanced-model) with additive attention. <br>
All the training and inference are presented in *.ipynb files. One for base mode and another for advanced.
## Architecture of the base model

Greedy sentence (choose the most probable word on each generation step):

* a skateboarder is doing a trick on a ramp .

Sampling (Choose words using the probablity distribution from the NN):

* a skateboarder is doing a trick on a ramp .
* a skateboarder is doing a trick on a ramp .
* a man riding a skateboard on top of a cement ramp .
* a man on a skateboard doing a trick on a ramp .
* a skateboarder is doing a trick on a ramp .
